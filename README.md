# VPN Implementation for Corporate Sites

## Project Overview
This project aims to securely connect two corporate sites using a VPN (Virtual Private Network) and enhance the network's performance, reliability, and security by integrating VLANs, OSPF, HSRP, STP, DHCP, and using Cisco Packet Tracer for simulation.

## Objectives
- Establish a secure site-to-site VPN connection using IPsec.
- Segment the network using VLANs for improved efficiency and security.
- Enable dynamic routing between sites with OSPF.
- Ensure network redundancy and high availability with HSRP.
- Prevent network loops with STP.
- Automate IP address allocation with DHCP.
- Enhance network security with firewalls.

## Network Topology
- **Site A:** [Description of Site A, including network devices and IP addresses]
- **Site B:** [Description of Site B, including network devices and IP addresses]

## Protocols and Technologies
- **IPsec (Internet Protocol Security):** Secure communication between the two sites.
- **VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network):** Network segmentation for efficiency and security.
- **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First):** Dynamic routing protocol for optimal path selection.
- **HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol):** Network redundancy and high availability.
- **STP (Spanning Tree Protocol):** Prevention of network loops.
- **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol):** Automated IP address allocation for network devices.
- **Firewall:** Enhanced network security by controlling incoming and outgoing traffic based on predefined security rules.

## Suggested Hardware
- **Routers:** Cisco ISR (Integrated Services Routers) such as Cisco ISR 4300 Series
- **Switches:** Cisco Catalyst switches such as Cisco Catalyst 2960 or 3650 Series
- **Firewalls:** Cisco ASA (Adaptive Security Appliance) for enhanced security
- **Servers:** Dedicated DHCP servers or routers with DHCP capabilities

## Implementation Steps
1. **Define Requirements**
   - Determine the purpose and requirements for the VPN connection (bandwidth, security, availability).
2. **Choose VPN Protocol**
   - Select IPsec for the site-to-site VPN.
3. **Select VPN Devices**
   - Use appropriate devices for each site, such as Cisco routers or firewalls (e.g., Cisco ASA).
4. **Configure the VPN Gateway**
   - Set up the VPN gateways on both sites with the IPsec settings.
5. **Set Up VLANs**
   - Configure VLANs on switches and assign devices to the appropriate VLANs.
   - Use 802.1Q for VLAN tagging.
6. **Enable OSPF**
   - Configure OSPF on routers for dynamic routing between the sites.
7. **Configure HSRP**
   - Set up HSRP on routers for redundancy and high availability.
8. **Implement STP**
   - Configure STP on switches to prevent network loops.
9. **Set Up DHCP**
   - Configure DHCP on routers or dedicated DHCP servers to automatically assign IP addresses to network devices.
   - Define DHCP pools for each VLAN.
10. **Configure Firewalls**
    - Set up firewalls to control incoming and outgoing traffic based on predefined security rules.
    - Ensure that the firewall policies are aligned with the organization's security requirements.
11. **Test and Monitor**
    - Verify connectivity, test the VPN tunnel, and monitor performance and availability.

## Simulation Using Cisco Packet Tracer
- **Purpose:** Use Cisco Packet Tracer to simulate the network setup and configurations.
- **Application:** Create a virtual network topology in Packet Tracer, configure the protocols and devices, and test the connectivity and performance.
